# Usage

## Requirements

To use PowerSelectInfinity, your app or addon must have a `devDependency` of **Ember v3.15** or higher.

## Installation

```
ember install @gavant/power-select-infinity
```

For this addon to work properly, you must use SASS:

```
ember install ember-cli-sass
```

Upon addon installation, add an import to your app.scss if it isn't already there.

```
@import 'gavant-ember-power-select-infinity';
```
